        Licensed under the Artistic License: 
        http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php
        
Preamble

        The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a 
        Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some 
        semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while 
        giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package
            in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable 
        modifications.

Definitions:

        * "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the 
        Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created 
        through textual modification. 

        * "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, 
        or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.

        * "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for
        the package. 

        * "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

        * "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of 
        media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. 
        (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but 
        only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the 
        fee.) 

        * "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item 
        itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also 
        means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same 
        conditions they received it.

        1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard 
        Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of 
        the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
        
        2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived 
        from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such 
        a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
        
        3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that 
        you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you 
        changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
        
                a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them 
                Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an 
                equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such 
                as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications 
                in the Standard Version of the Package.
        
                b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
        
                c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with 
                standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate 
                manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it 
                differs from the Standard Version.
        
                d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
        
        4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable 
        form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
        
                a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, 
                together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to 
                get the Standard Version.
        
                b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the 
                Package with your modifications.
        
                c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard 
                Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, 
                and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), 
                together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
        
                d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
        
        5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. 
        You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not 
        charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package 
        in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger 
        (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise 
        this Package as a product of your own.
        
        6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from 
        the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of 
        this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold 
        commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.
        
        7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not 
        be considered part of this Package.
        
        8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote 
        products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
        
        9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED 
        WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
        MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
